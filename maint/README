Scripts for indexing a Danbooru image database using iqdb.

These scripts are very specific and you'll probably have to customize them
heavily to suit your purposes. They assume a 3-level directory structure of 16
subdirectories each to hold the MD5-based preview files. The first 32 bits of
the MD5 are used as image DB for iqdb. If there's a collision, both files are
moved to the xx/ directory instead and receive a new random image ID prefix.
You can use make_dirs to create this structure.

danbooru-refresh
	Script designed to be run from cron to periodically remove old images
	and download and index new ones, then restart the iqdb server.

	Adjust the directory and DB names, and the HTTP proxy line.

danbooru-update
	Called by the above to download previews for new posts, and to check
	deleted posts once a day. Also stores image resolutions for services
	that provide them.

	Adjust the directory names, and create the appropriate tag cfg files,
	which should hold the login and password hash as described in the
	Danbooru API docs:
		$user="foobar";
		$pw='1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd';
		$host="danbooru.donmai.us";

danbooru-db:
	Check directory structure for dupe image IDs, and move them to xx/,
	removes deleted images and then adds new ones to the database.
