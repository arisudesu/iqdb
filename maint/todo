- always return exactly one line for add command, change scripts to filter it if they want
- when more output follows, use e.g. "100- added"
- removing in simple mode doesn't quite work; still return in queries?
- don't write anything in mode_alter if not modified
- queue mode_alter writes, don't touch file until ::save is called, then do it all at once
- switch backend to GD from ImageMagick
- instead of not ignoring MD5, change to always change MD5+tag like now, no need to check ignbase
- fix dupe finder
