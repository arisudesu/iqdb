iqdb-20080611:
- greatly reduced memory usage (and only slightly increased query
  times) with USE_DELTA_QUEUE in the Makefile (enabled by default)
- support for returning only results matching an AND/XOR bit mask
  set the mask with the command "query_opt mask <and> <xor>"
  (mask stored internally instead of the image width)
- the rehash command in "alter" mode (e.g. when run as
  "iqdb command ...") will update bucket sizes if they are out of
  sync, to reduce memory usage
- added PHP CurlTransfer class which implements the HTTP transfer
  with regular status updates on slow or stalled transfers
- fixed a bug that caused it to ignore width and height set
  while adding an image, as opposed to with "set_res" later
- several internal code cleanups and optimizations

iqdb-20080417:
- load data needed for queries into memory in readonly/simple mode
  (can be disabled by editing the Makefile configuration)
- removed support for multiple DBs in one file
- added support for direct manipulation of file (adding/removing pics)
  for faster updates
- added support for add/remove in simple/readonly mode as well, though
  these modifications can obviously not be saved and so need to be
  done both in memory and the DB file
- the "command" and "add" options now use the new alter mode, hence
  queries are not supported (along with some other info commands)
- corrupt database data now causes iqdb to abort with exit code 10.
  this indicates that restarting it is useless until the DB is fixed.

iqdb-20080303:
- preliminary find_duplicates function
- refactored web interface into frontend and XML backend

iqdb-20080218:
- first published version
