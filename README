1) Compiling

- install the ImageMagick development package
- run make
- if it fails, fix the Makefile or something

2) Running

The iqdb program has to operating modes: database maintenance and query server.

The maintenance mode is to update image databases: add and remove images, set
image properties and retrieve database stats. The query server mode listens on
a TCP port for query commands and returns matching image IDs.

a) Maintenance

Two major modes of calling the maintenance mode:

$ iqdb add foo.db

This mode expects a list of image IDs and filenames on stdin, in this format:
	<ID> [<width> <height>]:<filename>

The ID is the image ID in hexadecimal. If width and height are not specified,
the values from the filename are used instead. The filename can be any image
format supported by ImageMagick; the image will be resized to 128x128 and
added to the database. Duplicate IDs are ignored. Note that iqdb does not
remember the filename associated with an image ID, you are responsible for
keeping track of that. It refers to an image exclusively by the ID.

A more complex mode allows add, removing, updating and querying images for
multiple databases at once:

$ iqdb command foo.db bar.db baz.db

This mode expects commands on stdin. For a full list see do_commands() in
iqdb.cpp. The <dbid> argument refers to the dabase on the command line, with
the first argument being dbid=0. Commands of particular interest are:

	add <dbid> <imgid> [<width> <height>]:<filename>
		See above.
	remove <dbid> <imgid>
		Remove the given image from the DB.
	rehash <dbid>
		Re-hash the given database after removing images, before
		saving or querying it will work again.
	saveas <dbid> <filename>
		Save modified database in given file.
	done now
		Quit without saving.
	quit now
		Quit and save all databases to their original file.

b) Server mode

In query server mode, iqdb loads the databases into memory in read-only mode
to allow the fastest image queries. No database modifications are possible.

$ iqdb listen [IP:]port [-r] foo.db bar.db baz.db

Listens on the given IP:port (default localhost if no IP given) for commands,
after loading the given databases. If -r is specified and the port is
currently in use by another instance of iqdb, it will load the database and
then terminate that instance, to reduce the downtime due to loading the
databases.

Of particular interest are the following commands:

	query <dbid> <flags> <numres> <filename>
		Find numres images most similar to given filename.
		Flags is a bitmask:
			0 = normal operation
			1 = file contains a sketch, use different weights
			2 = force grayscale match, discard color information
			8 = consider image width:height as set ID instead and
			    return only the best match for each set
			16= discard common coefficients (those present in at
			    least 10% of all images), this finds an identical
			    match much faster but the non-matching images have
			    less similarity

	multi_query <dbid> <flags> <numres> [+ <dbid2> <flags2> <numres2> +...] <filename>
		Merge query results from multiple databases. This adjusts the
		individual scores to deal with varying similarity noise levels
		in different databases (the noise level depends on the number
		of images in the DB and how self-similar they are).

The server has the following possible responses:

	100 <text>
		General informational message.
	101 <key>=<value>
		Specific parseable information.
	200 <imgid> <score> <width> <height>
		Query result.
	201 <dbid> <imgid> <score> <width> <height>
		Multi-query result.
	300 <text>
		General error message.
	301 <exception> <description>
		Non-fatal error message (e.g. invalid image ID, or unreadable
		image file)
	302 <exception> <description>
		Fatal error message (e.g. corrupted database)

3) Querying

The file iqdb.php holds sample PHP code to connect to a running iqdb server
and queries it for similar images.
